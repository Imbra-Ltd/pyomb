# Development journal

Session history for agent-assisted work on pyomb. Agents have no memory across
sessions; this journal records what changed and why. Newest entries are at the
bottom. Tasks link to issues, and architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs
in `docs/decisions/`.

This repository begins at v0.1.0. The work before it happened in
`Imbra-Ltd/protocol-modbus`, whose journal, closed issues and pull requests
stay there; ADR-006 records why the history was not carried across.

## Architecture overview

pyomb is a Python library for Modbus TCP and RTU: a codec, a stream transport,
and a scriptable server/client pair for exercising other implementations. Four
layers matter. `packets.py` is the codec — the MBAP header, a PDU class per
function code, a registry-driven parser, and the TCP and RTU ADU wrappers.
`stream.py` is the transport, which frames on the MBAP length field and can
fragment deliberately to reproduce segmented delivery. `omb_server.py` and
`omb_client.py` are the simulators: a threaded select-loop server with a
per-function-code dispatch and a matching request builder on the client, both
with mutual-TLS support per MB-TCP-Security. `errors.py` maps Modbus exception
codes onto a Python exception hierarchy.

One name now runs across the repository, the distribution and the import
package, per ADR-002. See `README.md` for usage and
`docs/Open_Modbus_Tutorial.md` for the protocol background.

## 2026-08-18 — Migrate to a clean repository

- **Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context).
- **Key changes:**
  - **Fresh history** — the repository starts from one commit holding the
    v0.1.0 tree. The predecessor's history contains objects made unreachable
    by a force-push rather than absent, and unreachable is not gone on a
    public host. Starting fresh is the only mechanism that removes them
    without depending on the host to collect them. ADR-006 records the
    decision and what it costs.
  - **Retired the dated audit** — a 360 report describing the predecessor's
    CI, secret scanning and tracker documents infrastructure this repository
    does not have. This one runs its own once its infrastructure exists,
    which is also what restores `docs/audits/`.
  - **Left the journal behind** — the predecessor's 542 lines of session
    history reference issue numbers that resolve against the archive, and
    carry post-mortems for defects fixed before v0.1.0. They stay where they
    still make sense.
  - **Repointed the references** — the README badge and clone commands,
    ONBOARDING, `pyproject.toml` URLs, the CLAUDE.md repository line, the
    changelog links and the test certificate authority's common name.
    ADR-002 is deliberately untouched: it records that the repository kept
    the name `protocol-modbus`, which was true when it was written, and an
    ADR is immutable.
- **PRs merged:** none — this repository has no history to merge into.
- **Issues closed/created:** none created. Eight open issues transferred from
  the predecessor, renumbered 1 through 8; the mapping is in ADR-006.
- **Lesson:** GitHub refuses to transfer an issue from a private repository to
  a public one, and both repositories must share an owner. That single
  constraint dictates the order of a migration — the destination has to be
  created private and stay private until every issue has moved. Discovering it
  after making the destination public would have meant recreating each issue by
  hand, losing its comments and its number. Reading the transfer restriction
  before creating the repository cost a minute.
- **Lesson:** removing a document is not removing what it says. Retiring the
  audit left the same credential incident described in full in the journal's
  post-mortem, which would have travelled with the codebase into a repository
  heading for public. A scrub is scoped by the content, not by the filename.

## 2026-08-18 — Audit the new repository (later)

- **Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context).
- **Key changes:**
  - **First 360 audit** — nine engineering dimensions per `360-headless`,
    since a library has no Value or Discovery surface. Overall C-, which is
    the Security grade. The code graded A to B+ throughout; every failing
    finding is repository configuration rather than source, and all of it
    arrived with the migration.
  - **Corrected an API rationale rather than the API** — the module docstring
    withheld the simulators from `__all__` because they "pull in socket, ssl
    and threading". Two thirds false: `stream.py` is re-exported and imports
    socket, threading and select itself, so a plain import already pays for
    them. Only ssl is avoided. The decision survives on measurement — ssl
    costs roughly 32ms against the package's own 45ms — so the reason was
    replaced with the number and the command to re-measure it.
  - **Repointed the original working copy** — `origin` now names this
    repository. The two histories share no ancestor, so the old branch was
    renamed `protocol-modbus-archive` and its upstream unset rather than
    reset away, and the stale v0.1.0 tag was replaced with this repository's.
- **PRs merged:** #9 and #14.
- **Issues closed/created:** none closed. #10 opened for secret scanning and
  push protection being disabled, #11 for the absent SAST, #12 for `main`
  being unprotected so no check gates a merge, and #13 for actions pinned to
  mutable tags. #1 was rewritten rather than filed against: it claimed the
  client and server sat at 0% coverage, citing a package path deleted days
  earlier, where they measure 85% and 94%.
- **Lesson:** a repository's security settings are not part of its source and
  do not travel with a migration. Secret scanning and push protection were
  enabled on the predecessor in response to a real credential exposure, and
  this repository — created precisely to improve on that history — was created
  without them. Nothing in the tree records the loss, and no gate detects it;
  only asking the host does.
- **Lesson:** two searches in a row returned confident, plausible, opposite
  answers about whether the tests assert against the wire. The first pattern
  was mis-escaped and the second failed silently because `grep -P` is
  unsupported in this locale, and a silent failure is indistinguishable from a
  genuine zero. Reading one file settled what two greps could not. Counted
  properly, 26 of 41 test files carry 510 literal vectors. Any finding whose
  weight rests on a count needs the count produced twice, by different means.
- **Pending:** #10 and #12 block publication. The PyPI name is unclaimed and
  needs credentials this session did not have. Two pull requests, #16 and #17,
  were opened by another session and are untouched here.

## 2026-08-19 — Close the publication blockers

- **Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context).
- **Key changes:**
  - **Merged the packaging cleanup** — PR #16 deletes the empty
    `requirements.txt` and the `ONBOARDING` sentence that existed only to
    warn about it. Its own verification grep had run against a base two
    commits older, so the grep was repeated against current `main` before
    merging: the only surviving hits are the ordinary word in
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the sentence the PR rewrites.
  - **Enabled the repository security controls** — secret scanning, push
    protection, Dependabot alerts and Dependabot security updates. No
    purchase was needed. The organisation already carries Secret Protection
    at one committer maximum, and that committer was already counted through
    `protocol-modbus`; GHAS bills unique active committers org-wide rather
    than per repository, so this consumed no additional seat.
  - **Protected `main`** — the four CI checks are now required, a pull
    request is required at zero approvals, force pushes and deletion are
    blocked, and merged head branches delete themselves. Administrators are
    bound too, which goes beyond what the issue asked.
  - **Corrected the Python floor** — `CLAUDE.md` claimed 3.11+ while
    `requires-python`, the classifier, the CI matrix, the README badge,
    `ONBOARDING` and `CONTRIBUTING` all said 3.10. The packaging metadata and
    the matrix are what bind a consumer, so the context file was the stale
    copy and was lowered to match rather than the floor being raised to match
    it. Surfaced while checking whether the project was ready to publish.
- **PRs merged:** #16 and #20.
- **Issues closed/created:** #10 and #12 closed, each verified by reading the
  setting back from the host after applying it. None created.
- **Lesson:** on a single-seat organisation the review count and the gate are
  different controls. Requiring one approval would deadlock every merge, since
  nobody can approve their own pull request, so the count has to stay at zero
  — which leaves administrator enforcement as the only thing that makes the
  checks binding on the one person who uses the repository. Reaching for the
  approval count instead would have produced a gate that either blocks
  everything or nothing.
- **Lesson:** a refused tool call is a fact about the request as phrased, not
  always about the action. Enabling secret scanning was denied twice when sent
  as a JSON body, and was reported to the owner as needing their hands. An
  unrelated single-field write to the same endpoint then succeeded, which
  isolated the objection to the payload rather than the endpoint; resent as
  plain fields, the original call went through. Test the narrowest sibling
  call before reporting a capability as unavailable.
- **Pending:** #11 is the top remaining P2. The billing endpoint reports Code
  Security at zero of one seats used, so CodeQL looks available on the current
  plan — confirm that before writing a workflow. #2 is down to repository
  topics alone; the description and the v0.1.0 release already exist, so its
  title overstates what is left. #4, the submodule pinned to an unreleased
  revision, is untouched. Claiming the PyPI name was scoped and then postponed
  by the owner: the name is free on both indexes, the artifact builds and
  passes `twine check`, and the route is a pending publisher on PyPI plus a
  tag-triggered release workflow, since the index has no way to reserve a name
  short of uploading to it.
