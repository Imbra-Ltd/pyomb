# Development journal

Session history for agent-assisted work on pyomb. Agents have no memory across
sessions; this journal records what changed and why. Newest entries are at the
bottom. Tasks link to issues, and architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs
in `docs/decisions/`.

This repository begins at v0.1.0. The work before it happened in
`Imbra-Ltd/protocol-modbus`, whose journal, closed issues and pull requests
stay there; ADR-006 records why the history was not carried across.

## Architecture overview

pyomb is a Python library for Modbus TCP and RTU: a codec, a stream transport,
and a scriptable server/client pair for exercising other implementations. Four
layers matter. `packets.py` is the codec — the MBAP header, a PDU class per
function code, a registry-driven parser, and the TCP and RTU ADU wrappers.
`stream.py` is the transport, which frames on the MBAP length field and can
fragment deliberately to reproduce segmented delivery. `omb_server.py` and
`omb_client.py` are the simulators: a threaded select-loop server with a
per-function-code dispatch and a matching request builder on the client, both
with mutual-TLS support per MB-TCP-Security. `errors.py` maps Modbus exception
codes onto a Python exception hierarchy.

One name now runs across the repository, the distribution and the import
package, per ADR-002. See `README.md` for usage and
`docs/Open_Modbus_Tutorial.md` for the protocol background.

## 2026-08-18 — Migrate to a clean repository

- **Tool:** Claude Code (Opus 5, 1M context).
- **Key changes:**
  - **Fresh history** — the repository starts from one commit holding the
    v0.1.0 tree. The predecessor's history contains objects made unreachable
    by a force-push rather than absent, and unreachable is not gone on a
    public host. Starting fresh is the only mechanism that removes them
    without depending on the host to collect them. ADR-006 records the
    decision and what it costs.
  - **Retired the dated audit** — a 360 report describing the predecessor's
    CI, secret scanning and tracker documents infrastructure this repository
    does not have. This one runs its own once its infrastructure exists,
    which is also what restores `docs/audits/`.
  - **Left the journal behind** — the predecessor's 542 lines of session
    history reference issue numbers that resolve against the archive, and
    carry post-mortems for defects fixed before v0.1.0. They stay where they
    still make sense.
  - **Repointed the references** — the README badge and clone commands,
    ONBOARDING, `pyproject.toml` URLs, the CLAUDE.md repository line, the
    changelog links and the test certificate authority's common name.
    ADR-002 is deliberately untouched: it records that the repository kept
    the name `protocol-modbus`, which was true when it was written, and an
    ADR is immutable.
- **PRs merged:** none — this repository has no history to merge into.
- **Issues closed/created:** none created. Eight open issues transferred from
  the predecessor, renumbered 1 through 8; the mapping is in ADR-006.
- **Lesson:** GitHub refuses to transfer an issue from a private repository to
  a public one, and both repositories must share an owner. That single
  constraint dictates the order of a migration — the destination has to be
  created private and stay private until every issue has moved. Discovering it
  after making the destination public would have meant recreating each issue by
  hand, losing its comments and its number. Reading the transfer restriction
  before creating the repository cost a minute.
- **Lesson:** removing a document is not removing what it says. Retiring the
  audit left the same credential incident described in full in the journal's
  post-mortem, which would have travelled with the codebase into a repository
  heading for public. A scrub is scoped by the content, not by the filename.
